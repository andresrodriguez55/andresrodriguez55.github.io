Before the new song of animals as leaders had come out but just when I started doing this blog I came across the nice surprise that spiritbox released a new album, I was not a big fan of this band but I guess not seeing News in recent times in prog metal I ended up listening to them, I know that their genre is also prog but I don't know why they have always sounded different to this genre (call me crazy).

I was fascinated with the album, I think that I had only experienced this feeling with plini's kind album, something that when I remember it I create nostalgia, nostalgia for remembering that at some time I could record some songs and practice.

Since the pandemic began, I have tried to keep myself motivated as much as possible for the future, be it from work or from new social experiences. Especially this year I have tried to learn things that I may not have been able to learn in the absence of a pandemic.

It may all sound very good, but at the same time by doing this I have realized that I have forgotten things like recordings, etc.
Every day I feel motivated to continue and learn something new about computer science or do something social and for this reason I really don't want to record much. Like I said, the nostalgia that I suffered at the same time gave me happiness, because it made me remember that about 2-3 years ago there was a teenager who had no idea that he would focus on other things in the future.

I specifically put these two songs on the previous day and the truth is that they made me want to continue with a desire that I had in high school, to be able to have a hobby band. I also have in mind to continue composing and recording when I feel ready and motivated enough again, but the truth is that it is a very difficult task, I dont have bass or keyboard, which made it very difficult for me at the time to make those recordings, all of them. they were recorded with just a guitar, a medium quality sound card, and some VSTs.

Putting this issue aside, I look forward to the release of the new animals as leaders album, maybe when the album comes out, listening to it will take away all the desire for everything I have said, because the monster of tosin really is from another world, as I have said, there may not have been many new features in the prog, but I must admit that some guitarists have gone to another level, tosin was already there, but on the other hand, manuel gardner and polyphia have made themselves quite noticeable, not because of ibanez advertisements, if not for the new implementations (I speak for tim) of their techniques and the new content that they have been publishing.

I have not named plini or intervals because the truth is I do not know why but his new albums did not fascinate me like the others he has, if I must admit that there are 2 or 3 songs of each one that I liked very much, but speaking in full with The albums did not give me the sensation that their albums KIND and THE WAY FORWARD would give me, but I also leave here the songs which I think were the best of their albums
