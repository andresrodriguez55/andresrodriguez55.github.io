Welcome to my mind! This is my personal space. Here I write any experience, thought or thing that I have just learned.

I am a Spanish, I was born in 1999 and I study computer engineering at Ege University located in Turkey. I love to learn new things, work hard, play the guitar and socialize with foreigners.
